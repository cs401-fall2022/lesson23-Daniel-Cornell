## Experience

Creating this blogging website has been a really fun challenge. Most of the trouble that I had was with styling
especially with the classic issue of trying to center a div. I even decided to implement some advanced checking
on my edit/create pages with a style which was really fun to implement. Overall everything for this lab was well
specified and I had a ton of fun working on it.

## Known issues or Bugs

For create and edit on form submittal a new tab saying Created pops up. This doesn't break the functionality
so I don't find it to be a huge issue
